# <Horiseon-Marketing-Mockup-Tidy>
## Description
We have been provided with a index.html, style.css and a number of images that have been used to create a mockup landing page for
Horiseion Marketing. 
However, there were we issues with the html and css files that needed to be addressed so that they worked correcrly. 

Important aspects which needed to be addressed were:
-Making sure the html sementics were correct.
-That the structre, positioning and accessability to different aspects of the webpage were correct. 
-That all images had the correct html semantics associated with deploying images to a webpage.
-That heading attriubtes fall in sequential order.
-That the title element of the webpage was appropriately named. 
-CSS file has neat, tidy and if elements could be consolidated that they were. 
-That the files were correctly deployed to GitHub, this included 
    -commiting the work with notes
    -ensuring there is a file that links to the HTML code (for other people to view)
    -ensuring there is a link to the Horiseion-Marketing-Mockup landing page so it can be viewed.


This project was important to undertake as it allowed me to implement the skills i have learnt in the early stages of this course as well and practice uploading my worked on files to Git. 

What did I learn?
I learnt the important of checking your html file and making sure that all html semenatics are correctly filled out. 
I also learnt that CSS is an important part of web development and how you can apply many CSS attributes to similar 'class="....". 
This is important as it keeps your CSS file tidy and is easier to follow / work with.
