# <Horiseon-Marketing-Mockup-Tidy>
## Description
We have been provided with a index.html, style.css and a number of images that have been used to create a mockup landing page for
Horiseion Marketing. 
However, there were we issues with the html and css files that needed to be addressed so that they worked correcrly. 

Important aspects which needed to be addressed were:
-Making sure the html sementics were correct.
-That the structre, positioning and accessability to different aspects of the webpage were correct. 
-That all images had the correct html semantics associated with deploying images to a webpage.
-That heading attriubtes fall in sequential order.
-That the title element of the webpage was appropriately named. 
-CSS file has neat, tidy and if elements could be consolidated that they were. 
-That the files were correctly deployed to GitHub, this included 
    -commiting the work with notes
    -ensuring there is a file that links to the HTML code (for other people to view)
    -ensuring there is a link to the Horiseion-Marketing-Mockup landing page so it can be viewed.


This project was important to undertake as it allowed me to implement the skills i have learnt in the early stages of this course as well and practice uploading my worked on files to Git. 

What did I learn?
I learnt the important of checking your html file and making sure that all html semenatics are correctly filled out. 
I also learnt that CSS is an important part of web development and how you can apply many CSS attributes to similar 'class="....". 
This is important as it keeps your CSS file tidy and is easier to follow / work with. 


## Installation


What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
## Credits
List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
## License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
## Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
## How to Contribute
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
## Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
